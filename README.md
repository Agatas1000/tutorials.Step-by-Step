This is a collection of tutorials for the FIWARE platform. Each tutorial
consists of a series of exercises to demonstrate the correct use of individual
FIWARE components and shows the flow of context data within a simple Smart
Solution either by connecting to a series of dummy IoT devices or manipulating
the context directly or programmatically.

## Install

To download the full set of tutorials, simply clone this repository:

```console
git clone https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Step-by-Step.git
cd tutorials.Step-by-Step/
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Docker and Docker Compose

Each tutorial runs all components using [Docker](https://www.docker.com).
**Docker** is a container technology which allows to different components
isolated into their respective environments.

-   To install Docker on Windows follow the instructions
    [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)
-   To install Docker on Mac follow the instructions
    [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/)
-   To install Docker on Linux follow the instructions
    [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

**Docker Compose** is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker
applications. A series of `*.yaml` files are used configure the required
services for the application. This means all container services can be brought
up in a single command. Docker Compose is installed by default as part of Docker
for Windows and Docker for Mac, however Linux users will need to follow the
instructions found [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

You can check your current **Docker** and **Docker Compose** versions using the
following commands:

```console
docker-compose -v
docker version
```

Please ensure that you are using Docker version 18.03 or higher and Docker
Compose 1.21 or higher and upgrade if necessary.

### Postman

The tutorials which use HTTP requests supply a collection for use with the
Postman utility. Postman is a testing framework for REST APIs. The tool can be
downloaded from www.getpostman.com.

### Cygwin for Windows

We will start up our services using a simple Bash script. Windows users should
download [cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) to provide a command-line
functionality similar to a Linux distribution on Windows.

## Usage

Most tutorials supply a `services` script to start the containers:

```console
cd <tutorial-name>
./services start
```

### Following the tutorial exercises via Postman

Each tutorial submodule contains one or more `docker-compose.yml` files, along
with a Postman collection containing the necessary HTTP requests: import the
collection into Postman and follow the instructions.

### Following the tutorial exercises from the command-line

Each submodule contains full instructions in README which details the
appropriate bash commands (cUrl and Docker Compose) to run.

Full instructions can be found within the
[documentation](https://fiware-tutorials.rtfd.io)
